# Uncommon React Native Build Error: Dependency Conflicts in Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue in React Native development: build failures due to dependency conflicts, especially those involving native modules.  The error is often difficult to diagnose due to its cryptic nature and the complexities of native module linking.

## Problem

The project uses a third-party library that has conflicting dependencies with other packages or the core React Native project. This might lead to inconsistencies during the linking process, resulting in build failures during either Android or iOS build. The error messages may not directly point to the root cause.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the `package.json` and `android/build.gradle` (or `ios/Podfile`) files to identify and resolve conflicts.

This may involve:

* **Version Alignment:** Ensuring that all dependencies, including native modules, are compatible with each other and the current React Native version.
* **Dependency Pruning:** Removing unnecessary or redundant dependencies.
* **Manual Linking:** In some cases, manual linking of native modules might be required, using appropriate commands for Android and iOS.
* **Cleaning and Rebuilding:**  A clean build process will sometimes solve the problem.
* **Checking native code:** If the issue persists, it might require debugging within the native code of the third-party module.

This example highlights a scenario where a conflict between native modules arises, leading to a build error.  The solution demonstrates how dependency review and version adjustment can resolve the conflict.
