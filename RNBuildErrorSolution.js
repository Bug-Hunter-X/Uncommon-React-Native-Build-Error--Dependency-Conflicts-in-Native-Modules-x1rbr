// RNBuildErrorSolution.js
// Solution: Carefully review your dependencies, especially native modules.
// Ensure versions are compatible.
// If using a package manager like yarn or npm, use `yarn dedupe` or `npm dedupe` to remove duplicate and conflicting packages.
// For more complex cases, manually link your native modules according to their respective instructions.
// If the problem is within a third-party library, consider reporting an issue to the maintainers. 
// This example might involve manually adjusting versions of modules to resolve the conflict.
// Clean your project (using `yarn clean` or `npm run clean`) before trying to build again.

// Example of version adjustments in package.json (hypothetical):
// ...
// "dependencies": {
//   "react-native-maps": "^1.3.0", // Adjust to compatible version
//   "react-native-camera": "^4.0.0" // Adjust to compatible version
// }
// ...
// Example of manual linking (adjust depending on the native module instructions)
