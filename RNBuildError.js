This error occurs when you are using a third-party library or package that has some dependency conflicts or incompatibility issues with other packages in your project.  It usually occurs during the build process, when React Native tries to resolve dependencies and link native modules.  The error message may point to specific native modules which are failing to link properly.  Sometimes it's caused by issues in the native code itself (Android or iOS), or mismatched versions of React Native and the third-party library.  It can manifest as a cryptic error message, a failed build, or runtime crashes.
